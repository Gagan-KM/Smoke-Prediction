# Smoke Prediction Using Machine Learning

#### Overview
This project focuses on developing a smoke prediction model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers. The aim is to create a model that can accurately predict whether an individual smokes based on various health and demographic attributes.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of health examination records with labeled information indicating smoking status. It includes attributes such as age, height, weight, waist circumference, vision and hearing measurements, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant health metrics.

#### Approach
**Data Preprocessing:**
- Handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing/standardizing the data.
- Encoding categorical variables if any.
- Balancing the dataset to handle any class imbalances.

**Feature Engineering:**
- Selecting relevant features based on domain knowledge and feature importance analysis.
- Creating new features if necessary to enhance model performance.

**Model Selection:**
- Implementing Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers due to their effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
- Tuning hyperparameters using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search for optimal model performance.

**Model Training:**
- Training both Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers on the preprocessed dataset.
- Using cross-validation to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.

**Evaluation:**
- Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Comparing the performance of both classifiers to select the best model.

#### Results
The models demonstrated solid performance in predicting smoking status. The Logistic Regression model provided a straightforward interpretation of the coefficients related to each feature, while the Random Forest classifier offered robust performance through ensemble learning, handling non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively.

#### Conclusion
This project successfully developed a smoke prediction model using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers. Both models showed reliable performance, with Random Forest slightly outperforming in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness. Future work could involve exploring more sophisticated algorithms such as Gradient Boosting or deep learning techniques to further enhance prediction accuracy.

Implementing these models can significantly contribute to public health initiatives by identifying potential smokers and facilitating targeted interventions. Future iterations may also focus on incorporating additional features or leveraging more complex ensemble methods to improve predictive performance.
